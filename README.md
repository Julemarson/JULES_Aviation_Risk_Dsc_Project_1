# Aviantion risk - My_Dsc_1stProject

## Civil aviation accidents

This project analyzes civil risk accident [data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/khsamaha/aviation-accident-database-synopses) from 19962 to 2023 to identify the *lowest-risk* aircraft for commercial an private enterprises. I leverage this data from the National Transportation Safety Board *(NTSB)* an there after I used my academic and profesionnal skills to :
- Explore, and clean the dataset,
- Apply aggregattion techniques to manipulate and analyse the data
- Extract meaningfull insights through salients visualizations.

The goal of this wonderful project is to provide *actionable recommendations* for a company expanding into the aviation industry, helping decision-makers select aircraft with with the best safety records. The analysis is presented through intercative visualizations and a comprehensive dashboard, enabling easy exploration of risk across different aircrafts types, manufactures, and time periods.


This project showcases skilss in data cleanning, exploratory Data Analysis *(EDA)*, risk assessment, and visualization, with focus on real-orld Business impact
